# [WIP] django_receita_ws :snake:

A Django Web App used with [Receitaws](https://receitaws.com.br/api)

### TODO
* Large refactor.
  
    Since it is a old code, I need to review some logics and decisions I've made before.
  
* Enable automatic filling in of company information when try to register a new company using CNPJ.

    This is necessary to enable a fast company register.

* Chose a front-end framework.

    Currently the design of this porject is poor, since my knowledge about front-end tech is poor. I'm studying about React in my free time.
